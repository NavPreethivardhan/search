the forms were already given by cs50 then i added the border radius and color and hover elements to the 
submit button
and then i formatted the size of the search box and orientation of the searchbox to look similar to googles
and then i tried to find to closest color to the google page's background
after that i styled the 'google search' heading into the page such that it looks similar to google
after which i copied the html into another html docx for image search
and then i tried to modify the link as to open into the images page 
which i did by adding another fixed input tag whcih was invisible
and then i similarly copied it into the advanced search html doc 
where i then checked of how the queries are specifed in teh link and then tried to make something similar 
into the URL later i tried different ways to align the textboxes like 
using columns(using paddings)
and using padding from left and floats
and after many tries i used the table method to make the textboxs and the box labels as 
cells of a cell whose data i used in the table.
